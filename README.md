# Impossible Hangman

Try it out: [hangman.spencermoffat.com](https://hangman.spencermoffat.com)

Pull the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/smophat7/impossiblehangmanblazor)

A particularly frustrating version of hangman where the game actively works against the player. Adapted from my previous implementation as a command-line Java game.

Stack: C#, .NET 6, Blazor Server

Hosting: Running in Docker container on a DigitalOcean "droplet" (Linux-based VM)
